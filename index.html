<h3 id="clickheretostartthevisualizationlsystemshtml"><strong><a href="lsystems.html">Click here to start the visualization</a></strong></h3>

<h2 id="howtousethissite">How to use this site:</h2>

<p>Clicking anywhere on the visualization will bring up a menu with a bunch of sliders you can use to change how the L-Systems are generated. Clicking off the menu will make it disppear. Using the menu you can control the following parameters: </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Fade time</em></strong>: The time it takes for a line to completely fade away</p></li>

<li><p><strong><em>Line length</em></strong>: The length of the shortest possible straight line (the distance that the turtle moves when it is told to move forward)</p></li>

<li><p><strong><em>Line width</em></strong>: The width of the lines being drawn</p></li>

<li><p><strong><em>Lines per frame</em></strong>: The number of lines that are drawn every frame</p></li>

<li><p><strong><em>Time per frame</em></strong>: How often a frame is drawn</p></li>

<li><p><strong><em>Angle randomness</em></strong>: 100% angle randomness means all angles are randomly chosen from between 5° and 180°. 0% angle randomness means all angles are chosen from a pool of around 10 "nice looking" angles (such as 90°, 20°, etc)</p></li>

<li><p><strong><em>Maximum system length</em></strong>: The length to grow each system's string before switching to a new system     </p></li>
</ul>

<p>The remaining parameters are explained in the following diagram of a complete L-System:  </p>

<p>If you want to share your current settings you can click the <strong><em>save settings in url</em></strong> button at the bottom of the menu and it will change the URL of the page to one that includes all the current parameters.</p>

<h2 id="abriefexplanationoflsystems">A brief explanation of L-Systems:</h2>

<h3 id="growinganlsystem">Growing an L-System</h3>

<p>An L-System is a string rewriting system that can generate fractal and tree like structures. They consist of a <strong>seed</strong> string and a set of <strong>rules</strong> to grow the seed into a more complex string. Each rule operates on a single character of the string, and replaces that character with another string.
For example, consider the following seed and rules:  </p>

<pre><code>Seed: "abc"  
Rules:  
    "a" -&gt; "cc",  
    "c" -&gt; "ba"  
</code></pre>

<p>Applying these rules to the seed will yield the string <code>"ccbba"</code>. Now the same rules can be applied to this new string to grow the system even more:  </p>

<p><code>"ccbba"</code> becomes <code>"bababbcc"</code> <br />
<code>"bababbcc"</code> becomes <code>"bccbccbbbaba"</code> <br />
etc</p>

<h3 id="visualizinganlsystem">Visualizing an L-System</h3>

<p>L-Systems can be visualized in many different ways, but the most common method involves using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics">turtle</a>. <br />
First, you come up with an L-System as well as an arbitrary angle, <strong>A</strong>, to associate the L-System with. Then, you grow your L-System string by applying rules to the seed numerous times. To draw the L-System using the turtle you interpret every character of the grown string as an instruction to the turtle. Most L-Systems visualizers (including this one) use the following character set:</p>

<ul>
<li>"F": Move the turtle forward</li>

<li>"+": Turn the turtle A degrees clockwise</li>

<li>"-": Turn the turtle A degrees counterclockwise</li>

<li>"[": Push the current position of the turtle onto a stack</li>

<li>"]": Pop a position off the stack and move the turtle to that position</li>
</ul>

<p>Any other characters can be ignored by the turtle.</p>
